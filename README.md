# CleanLeashCo GitHub Pages

This repository contains a simple redirect page that automatically forwards visitors to [cleanleashco.com](https://cleanleashco.com).

## Purpose

This GitHub Pages site serves as a redirect landing page, ensuring that anyone who visits the GitHub Pages URL is automatically redirected to the main CleanLeashCo website.

## How it works

The redirect is implemented using multiple methods for maximum compatibility:

1. **HTML Meta Refresh**: `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://cleanleashco.com">`
2. **JavaScript Redirect**: `window.location.href = 'https://cleanleashco.com'`
3. **Manual Link**: A clickable link for users who prefer manual navigation

## Features

- Beautiful, modern loading page with animated spinner
- Responsive design that works on all devices
